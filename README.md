Packet Sniffing by wireshark

Wireshark is a tool used to capture network packets and anaylyse them. It can be used on wireless or wired, local or global networks.

In this activity, we are particularly using toot to sniff through user sensitive data like username and passwords used by user while logging in into vairous different servers, following various protocols.
Because every protocol has different security level of data packets sent, we see in what protocols, data sniffing is possible and where data is encrypted.
We will be analysing servers following http, https ( http protected with ssl/tls security layers), ftp, telnet, ssh.

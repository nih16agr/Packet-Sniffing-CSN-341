Packet Sniffing by wireshark

Wireshark is a tool used to capture network packets and anaylyse them. It can be used on wireless or wired, local or global networks.

In this activity, we are particularly using toot to sniff through user sensitive data like username and passwords used by user while logging in into vairous different servers, following various protocols.
Because every protocol has different security level of data packets sent, we see in what protocols, data sniffing is possible and where data is encrypted.
We will be analysing servers following http, https ( http protected with ssl/tls security layers), ftp, telnet, ssh.

Secondly we aim to track all the network traffic in an organisation hence we track what all websites are being visited.
For this we capture the packets transmitted over network through wireshark and save it. Based on IPs and MAC addresses of the systems, it is analysed that what are the top 3 websites which are visited regularly.
